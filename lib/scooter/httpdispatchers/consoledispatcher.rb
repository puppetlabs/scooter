      # This class is designed to interact with any of the pe-console-services:
      # RBAC, Node Classifier, and the Activity Service. The most common use
      # case will be for tests executed with beaker, for which you will want
      # to pass in the dashboard for initialization. The other parameter that
      # you can pass in optionally is credentials. Passing in credentials is
      # essential for building the correct routes if you are using RBAC users,
      # local users, or the default admin account. If no credentials are passed
      # in, the dispatcher defaults to using certificates to connect to the
      # API's directly.
      #
      # If you are using this class outside of beaker, you can initialize an
      # object without any parameters and supply your own dashboard as a String,
      # credentials, Faraday connection object, and ssl parameters. Note that
      # this is largely untested. Use outside of a Beaker test run at your own
      # risk.
      # @param dashboard [Unix::Host optional] the dashboard specified in your
      #   beaker config. If no dashboard is passed, then the initialization
      #   process is skipped and you must define the connection and dashboard
      #   manually.
      #
      # @param credentials(Hash optional) Provide credentials if you wish to
      #   communicate through the UI proxy. If no credentials are provided, then
      #   it is assumed the dispatching object will send traffic directly to the
      #   Services.
